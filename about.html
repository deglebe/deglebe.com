      <h3>about me</h3>
      <p>
        hello! i'm thomas (deglebe) bruce. i am a 20 year old computer
        scientist/engineer/software developer (formal training is in software
        engineering) based in upstate new york.
      </p>
      <p>
        my primary computing interests are operating systems, low power
        (perma)computing, and language design, and as such my particular domain
        of expertise lies in low-level development. i am also fairly
        knowledgeable about the history of cs and open-source, as well as
        machine learning applications in data science.
      </p>
      <p>
        my non-cs computer interests lie in occasional gaming (vsrg, factorio,
        minecraft, geoguessr), reading blogs, and listening to music.
      </p>
      <p>
        off the computer, i am an avid endurance runner and hiker (nordic skiing
        in the winter). i enjoy reading any literature i can get my hands on,
        tinkering with electronics, writing, studying languages, and cooking.
      </p>

      <h3>opinionated</h3>
      <p>
        there is nothing wrong with being opinionated, and a good portion of
        one's thought life is (or at least should be) spent determining where
        one's opinions line up with reality. here is a fairly broad summation of
        the more socially conscious opinions i hold.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >bigotry, discrimination, mis(ogyny/andry), racism, homophobia,
          transphobia, xenophobia, sexism, classism, and religious persecution
          are harmful!</em
        ><br /><br />a healthy society does not deny humanity to anyone, and a
        healthy heart values everyone equally. disrespecting a worldview that
        denies universal humanity and respect is not oppressive.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >humans are not disconnected for their environment, so to care for the
          environment is to care for humanity!</em
        ><br /><br />as scatman john said, "if part of your solution isn't
        ending the pollution then i don't want to hear your stories told."
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>borders do more to divide people than unify a nation!</em
        ><br /><br />how many times over the millenia have the lines we draw on
        maps changed? stop assigning the worth of people based on how far they
        live away from you and whether there's a border crossing to get to them.

      <p>
        all portions of this site were written by hand using posix tools and
        without the use of ai. the static site generator for the posts is
        written entirely using sh, sed, and awk. this site does not contain any
        javascript. all text is lowercase due to my personal preference toward
        monospace and carolingian miniscule.
