<h1>blocking the shorts in youtube</h1>
<p><em>10/07/2025</em></p>
<p>humanity's recent obsession with scrolling can be fairly well explained by the skinner box phenomenon<sup><a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1">1</a></sup>. this is especially prevalent in recent years with the unprecedented rise of short-form content. platforms such as tik-tok, reels, etc. capitalize off of the amount of your time you are (un)willing to spend scrolling through posts with the hope of illiciting a chuckle or smile or some short-lived positive feeling. however, one may find that, with effective introspection, these feelings tend to be neutral at best. as time is the most valuable thing one can give away, wasting it on neutral emotions and making money for already rich-beyond-imagination corporations seems like a shame. unfortunately, the wealth of information, legitimate entertainment, and good journalism present on youtube has become cluttered by google's own attempt at capitalizing on short-form content. it's been a few years since it was added to the platform, and more than once i've found myself sucked into it's sticky arms. no longer. i'm not here to argue why shorts are bad, but present my solution to the problem.</p>
<h2>existing solutions</h2>
<p>there are a few solutions to this scourge:</p>
<ul>
<li>quitting youtube entirely</li>
<li>trying to ignore it</li>
<li>using invidious or another frontend</li>
<li><a href="https://drewdevault.com/2016/11/16/Getting-on-without-Google.html">rss2email -> yt-dlp -> mpv</a></li>
<li>various extensions for firefox</li>
</ul>
<p>unfortunately, quitting youtube is simply impractical for most (including myself) due to the value detracted from it. trying to ignore it has been, on occasion, unsuccessful. invidious public instances are somewhat finnicky and i do not have the resources to dedicate to running an instance for myself. using rss2email requires too much effort. lastly, i'm attempting to minimize the number of extensions i am using so as to decrease fingerprinting.</p>
<h2>my solution</h2>
<p>the past year or so, i've been working on streamlining my web experience by writing tampermonkey scripts to get rid of various annoyances that pop up as i spend time online. the past few days now have been spent cleaning up and publishing these scripts in a repository. one of these scripts blocks all references to shorts i could find via css injection, and then checks for any other instances of shorts appearing and forces them not to load. super simple, but it works, is 62 loc (including the tampermonkey header), and doesn't leave gaps in the page.</p>

<h2>going forward and more scripts</h2>
<p>there seems to be a new functionality in youtube, "playables." i don't really spend much time on the homepage so i haven't given them much thought, but they do appear to be another example of attention capitalization and enshittification on the platform, so i may at some point write another script to remove that as well.</p>
<p>the rest of the scripts i've written can be found at <a href="https://github.com/deglebe/tmscripts">https://github.com/deglebe/tmscripts</a></p>
