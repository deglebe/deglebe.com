# human data isn't just about data

*14/07/2025*

it's about humans. we're living in a time where anyone can make their voice
heard about anything. i can sit in my room, type out my thoughts, and no longer
are my thoughts confined to my immediate social circle, or the speed at which
cows are killed and reeds are smashed[^1]. that's a power unknown to any of our
forebearers, and truthfully, it's one of the most beautiful results of all of
the development of computing (barring the unfortunate prevalence of vacuousness
and oppression) because it *should* give room for even the most traditionally
marginalised of voices. because of this, it is important to recognize the dual
importance of not only the content being output, but the human behind the
keyboard, presumably writing with the intention of it being read by other
humans.

### the dehumanization of tools

ivan illich, especially in *tools for conviviality* and *deschooling society*,
argues that tools (including language systems and educational structures) should
enhance human autonomy and creativity, not dominate or standardize or replace
it. writing for humans affirms this; it is a tool of conviviality[^2], an act of
fostering mutualism, broadening dialogue, and creating shared meaning. when
writing is directed toward algorithmic systems of ingestion (ai crawlers, seo),
it loses this characteristic. language loses its beauty as the strand of
connection between otherwise separated groups of humans. 

to write with humans in mind is to sacrificially and selflessly give one's brain
over to others to ingest. to write with computers in mind is to sell, to ignore
the realness of a human audience in favour of cold nlp systems. and don't try to
argue that llm interfaces are different since the end result is still human. a: 
we do not know that that will always be the case (it isn't now) and b: as long
as optimizing for crawlers brings more traffic, writing will still be made
subservient to those crawlers.

### communicative freedom

murray bookchin's political philosophy emphasises communicative freedom as
fundamental to societal liberation. language is not just expression but also an
act of mutual recognition. a mouth, unmatched by an ear, has no reason to move.

writing for other humans keeps up reciprocal relationships which are the basis
of true democracy. if, in writing, we cater primarily to dehumanized listeners,
we splinter and alienate humans who might otherwise find a piece as a rallying
point or something engaging or informative. writing for humans is therefore not
just an aesthetic ideal or "ethical;" it is a political act which maintains the
conditions necessary for civic participation.[^3]

### balzac: fragility and richness in human recognition

in *cousin pons*[^4], balzac's vision of society is that of one in decay, where
sentimental value, human connection, and the important of relationships have
been eclipsed by greed, social status elevation, and commodification. pons is
ultimately destroyed so that maximum value can be extracted from his lifelong
pursuit of that which he deems beautiful: human creation. an artist, he's
juxtaposed in a world which rejects art for instrumental value. he is "read,"
almost too literally, by a society that no longer knows how to read people.

the tragedy of *cousin pons* points to the need for writing that rejects the
purely transactional. human-directed writing preserves nuance, irony, wit,
longing, anger, joy, those layers of expression that can't be replicated by
data modelling and economic rationale. balzac's world becomes dystopian exactly
when human communication ceases to matter, because language no longer connects
people.

### in conclusion

to write for humans is:

- to affirm language as a relational tool
- to sustain political and ecological freedom through mutualism
- to preserve the emotional, ethical, and aesthetic depth of humanity

in a world commonly reshaped to accomidate technology and the market, writing
with a human reader in mind is a form of both cultural and preservational
resistance. it maintains space for humans to remain, well, human. we are not
data, not prompts, not users. it is not just about who reads our words or ideas,
but *how* they read them, and why we write them in the first place.
